# About
Using jQuery, DOM manipulation and bootstrap elements, I was able to create a dynamic daily planner app that you can use to organize your life. Users are shown the rows of the planner with different colors corresponding to the time of day. Events in the past will be grey and future elements will be green and the present time of the row will be red. Psuedocoding help a lot with the development of the app and the execution of how to use time to set the row coloring.

## Contributing

This app could not have been built without the help of fellow students, instructors, tutors, and TA's of the GT coding bootcamp.

Please reach out to me if you see ways that I can improve upon my code and complete the functionality.
